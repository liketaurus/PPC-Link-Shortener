# PPC-Link-Shortener
Simple 'local' link shortener service (based on Firebase Dynamic Links API) created as a 'replacement' of goo.gl, intended for a 'local' use only.

Project was created using the following:
* [Bootstrap 4](https://getbootstrap.com/)
* [Bare Bootstrap template](https://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/bare/)
* [jQuery](https://jquery.com/)
* [jQuery QRcode](https://github.com/jeromeetienne/jquery-qrcode)
* [Dexie.js](https://dexie.org/)
* [Firebase Dynamic Links REST API](https://firebase.google.com/docs/dynamic-links/rest)
* [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/)
* [clipboard.js](https://clipboardjs.com/)

At this time this is just a working prototype :-)
